# Tawaper
Tawaper is a smart queue management app that helps users reserve spots and track their turn in real-time. Hosters can create, control, and monitor queues with live updates, payments, and analytics.

Tawaper is a comprehensive queue management platform built to modernize and simplify how people wait in line—whether at clinics, service centers, barbershops, or any appointment-based business. It eliminates the need for physical waiting by allowing users to reserve their spot remotely using a code or QR scan and get real-time updates on their position in the queue.

For users, Tawaper offers an easy-to-use interface where they can enter a queue, view estimated wait times, receive notifications when their turn is near, and even pay service fees online via Fawaterak integration. Each reservation shows live progress, queue status, and host details for full transparency.

For hosters (service providers), Tawaper acts as a full admin tool. Hosters can create and manage multiple queues, set reservation limits, define time per customer, skip or notify next clients, and view who is currently in line. Every action automatically updates users in real time.

The system supports both mobile apps (for quick access) and a desktop version (for front-desk terminals), offering analytics dashboards, QR code generation, profile customization, and verified hoster features. Key metrics like daily users, average wait time, and live queue stats are presented with clear visual charts—ensuring efficient and data-driven service management.

Tawaper is designed with flexibility, professionalism, and scalability in mind—helping businesses offer a better, faster, and more organized customer experience.
